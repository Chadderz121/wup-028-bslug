WUP-028 adapter BrainSlug module
 by Alex "Chadderz" Chadwick

This repository contains a BrainSlug module to allow support for the WUP-028 GCN
controller to USB adapter to arbitrary Wii games. At the time of writing I don't
quite recall what state it is in, other than that it basically works. To compile
you will first need to install BrainSlug (though not necessarily compile it).
